# worldcup-database

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum and showcases my skills in creating a PostgreSQL database to manage information about the World Cup tournament. It involves setting up a database structure, inserting data from a CSV file, and running queries to analyze the performance of teams and games in the World Cup.
